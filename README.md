# Julia-Set-Generator
This program uses the NetLogo platform to generate and display a Julia Set. The Julia Set is a type of fractal that is created by iterating a complex function and determining whether each point in a given space belongs to the set or not. The program allows users to adjust various parameters of the function and the display to explore different aspects of the set.

## Requirements
* NetLogo 6.1 or later
* A computer with at least 2 GB of RAM

## Usage
1. Open the program in NetLogo.
2. Click the "Setup" button to generate the initial Julia Set.
3. Adjust the parameters “c-im” and “c-re” of the function and the display as desired.
4. Click the “Zoom” button to zoom in a selected region.

## Note
The higher the iteration count, the more detailed the set will be, but it will also take more processing power and time. Be aware of your computer's limitations.
